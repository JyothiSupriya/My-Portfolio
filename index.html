      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
      Data Scientist with over 5 years of experience delivering advanced AI and analytics solutions across academic research and enterprise environments. My expertise spans the full data science lifecycle from building scalable machine learning pipelines and NLP frameworks to developing multi-agent LLM systems and real-time personalization platforms.
      <br><br>
      I have architected and deployed robust solutions using Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Spark, and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), consistently transforming complex data into actionable insights that drive measurable business impact. At Lamar University, I pioneered a multi-agent investigation engine and engineered hybrid retrieval systems that dramatically accelerated research workflows and stakeholder decision-making. In industry roles, I automated incident analytics, predictive reporting, and recommendation systems, contributing to significant improvements in efficiency, accuracy, and user engagement.
      <br><br>
      Adept at collaborating across technical and non-technical teams, I thrive on solving real-world problems with data-driven approaches and clear communication. I am passionate about continuous learning, innovation, and building AI solutions that make a tangible difference for organizations and their clients.
